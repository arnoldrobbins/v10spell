.SH DESCRIPTION
.I V10spell
is the
.IR spell (1)
program from the Tenth Edition UNIX system,
updated (somewhat) for the 21st century.
.PP
.I V10spell
looks up words from the named
.I files
(standard input default)
in a public spelling list and in a private list.
Possible misspellings (words 
that occur in neither and are not plausibly derivable
from the former) are placed on the standard output.
.PP
.I V10spell
understands these options:
.TP
.B \-b
Check British spelling.
.TP
.B \-v
Print all words not literally in the spelling list, with
derivations.
.TP
.B \-x
Print on standard error, marked with
.BR = ,
every stem as it is looked up in the spelling list,
along with its affix classes.
Typically used for maintenance.
.TP
.B \-c
.br
.ns
.TP
.B \-C
Input is one word per line.
Output is a single byte per word, delivered immediately:
.B \-
if the word is rejected, 
.B +
if the word is accepted under
.BR \-c ,
or a digit if the word is accepted under
.BR \-C .
Digit zero indicates a word known directly; larger
numbers indicate words derived by increasingly
elaborate paths.
This is typically used by other programs piping queries to
.IR v10spell .
.PP
The private list, by default
.BR $HOME/lib/spelldict ,
is arranged one word per line and
.I must
be sorted.
.PP
Pertinent files may be specified by
environment variables, listed below with their default settings.
.PP
As a matter of policy, 
.I v10spell
does not admit multiple spellings of the same word.
Variants that follow general rules are preferred over
over those that don't, even when the unruly spelling is
more common.
Thus, in American usage, `modeled', `sizable', and `judgement' are
preferred to `modelled', `sizeable', and `judgment'.
Agglutinated variants are shunned: `crew member' and `back yard'
(noun) or `back-yard' (adjective) are preferred to
`crewmember' and  `backyard'.

.SH CASE SENSITIVITY
Unlike some other spelling checkers,
.I v10spell
does not totally ignore case when checking words,
and thus can be surprising.
Doug McIlroy explains:
.PP
.RS
You can derive words by adding affixes to words in the dictionary,
but not by deleting them. You can derive capitalized (initially or
wholly) from lowercase words; but you can't derive a lowercase
word from a capitalized word in the dictionary.
Thus from
.I Americanize
you cannot derive any of
.IR American ,
.IR America ,
.IR americanize ,
.IR american ,
[or]
.IR america .
.RE
.PP
In practice, because there are other words in the dictionary besides
.IR Americanize ,
most of the above words are recognized.
.SH BUGS
Words in a private list are recognized only by
exact match, including capitalization and affixing.
.PP
The spelling list's coverage is uneven;
in particular biology, medicine, and chemistry, and
perforce proper names,
are covered very lightly.
.PP
British spelling was done by an American.
.PP
.I V10spell
only handles \s-1ASCII\s+1 characters.
.PP
.I V10spell
no longer removes markup for
.IR troff (1),
.IR tex (1),
or
.IR latex (1).
