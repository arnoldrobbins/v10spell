There are five word lists, which are sorted together:

	list	the main corpus of words
	british	british spellings, where different from
	american
	local	a collection of words useful in our own
		lab, but not generally; mostly names and
		jargon
	stop	everything with code "s"

The word lists are annotated with affix codes, vaguely
related to parts of speech.  The codes are

	a	adjective
	adv	adverb
	comp	comparative & superlative
	d	don't suffix
	ed	takes -ed
	er	takes -er
	in	takes in- as a prefix instead of un-
	ion	takes -ion
	man	takes -man
	ms	"monosyllable"; double final consonant on affixing
	n	noun
	na	noun affix, e.g. -ism
	nopref	do not prefix
	pc	proper name or collective (don't pluralize)
	s	stop; an unwanted word that could sneak thru
	v	verb
	va	verb affix, e.g. -ize
	vi	irregular verb (no -ed)
	y	can be made into adjective with -y

The allowable affixes for each code are given in code.h

It is a good idea to list codes in the same standard order
in which they print under option -x:

	n,pc,v,vi,ed,a,er,comp,d,na,adv,ion,va,man,nopref,ms,in,y

	v = vi+ed
	s is incompatible with everything
